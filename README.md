Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is an adaption of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors.

The site is designed purely for entertainment purposes and to be fun and enjoyable to the user. The game is entirely based on chance and has an easy to use interface in order for the user to easily find the rules, the game area and the feedback form.

## **User Exerience (UX)**

### **Project Goals**

<ul>The website interface should be easy to understand and navigate clearly.</li>
<li>Should include an appealing color scheme or theme to engage the user.</li>
<li>To provide easily accessible instructions on how to play the game.</li>
<li>Offer users a form to fill in to provide any feedback.</li>
<li>Should be fully responsive across all platforms.</li>
</ul>

### **Color Scheme/Theme**

I have used a space theme for the website using white for the text color as a contrast against a black background. I have swapped these 2 colors around for hover effects. For the logo I used a a shade of purple (rgb(158, 1, 158)) with a white background to stand out.

### **Typography**

The main font I have used is Kanit with San-Serif being the back-up font if Kanit fails to load. For the logo I have used Rubik Mono One as this is a bold font which stands out. I used Google Fonts to get an idea of what styles would be good to use on my site and I used Fontjoy for appropriate pairings.

### **Wireframes**

**Balsamiq** has been used to showcase the appearance of the site and display the placement of the different elements whitin the pages.
