# **Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock**

<img src="/assets/images/RPSLS-amiresponsive" alt="responsive designs">

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is an adaption of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors.

The site is designed purely for entertainment purposes and to be fun and enjoyable to the user. The game is entirely based on chance and has an easy to use interface in order for the user to easily find the rules, the game area and the feedback form.

## **User Exerience (UX)**

### **Project Goals**

<ul>The website interface should be easy to understand and navigate clearly.</li>
<li>Should include an appealing color scheme or theme to engage the user.</li>
<li>To provide easily accessible instructions on how to play the game.</li>
<li>Offer users a form to fill in to provide any feedback.</li>
<li>Should be fully responsive across all platforms.</li>
</ul>

### **Color Scheme/Theme**

I have used a space theme for the website using white for the text color as a contrast against a black background. I have swapped these 2 colors around for hover effects. For the logo I used a a shade of purple (rgb(158, 1, 158)) with a white background to stand out.

### **Typography**

The main font I have used is Kanit with San-Serif being the back-up font if Kanit fails to load. For the logo I have used Rubik Mono One as this is a bold font which stands out. I used Google Fonts to get an idea of what styles would be good to use on my site and I used Fontjoy for appropriate pairings.

### **Wireframes**

**Balsamiq** has been used to showcase the appearance of the site and display the placement of the different elements whitin the pages.

### Header - Navigation Bar

- The footer contains links to social media platforms. Like the header the social media links also have a hover effect of the same color.

### Home page

<img src="/assets/images/RPSLS-Homepage-Screenshot.png" alt="Home page">

- For the main image on the landing page I've used a women meditating on wooden decking. This matches the brown and orange color scheme of the site and represents peace and mindfulness matching the sites goals.

- The landing page contains the About section which explains the purpose of the website.

### Game Page

<img src="/assets/images/RPSLS-Gamepage-Screenshot.png" alt="Game page">

- For the background image I used a man sitting on a rock peacefully looking out to sea. It has a calming feel to it. I have made the background image darker so that the writing can be seen more clearly.

- I've used three sections to provide information on different topics.

- Under the meditation section I have embedded a youtube video on meditation for better understanding.

### Feedback Page

- Background image of a women doing yoga which fits really well in the body page. Again I've made the background image darker for better contrast.

- Same as the body page I've used 3 sections for information on seperate topics.

- I've embedded a youtube video under the yoga section as a guide for users.

### Footer

<img src="/assets/images/RPSLS-Footer-Screenshot.png" alt="Footer">

- Same layout as the other two pages making the background image darker for better contrast.

- As there was less information on the 2 topics on the right 'Negative Thoughts' and 'Just Relax', I split the section in half and stacked them on top of eachother.

- Photos used from _Unsplash_ to link with bullet points.
